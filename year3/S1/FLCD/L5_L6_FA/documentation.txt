Finite Automata

-  class to  mimic finite automata way of behaving

- def readFromFile(): function to get the finite automata specifications form a .txt, and also checks if the finite automata is deterministic or not
- def  checkIfDeterministic(): checks if the finite automat is deterministic or not, by cehcking if a transitions has a unique after state
- def acceptSequesne(): fucntion to check if a sequence given by the user is accepted by the finite automata with the speciifications given from the .txt,
      checks if the symbols in the sequence are propperly arranged ( or valid) so that the finite automata can reach from the initial state, to the possible final states


TRANSITION FORMAT:

non_zero_digit = 1|2| .. |9
digit = 0|1|..|9
number = non_zero_digit{digit}
letter = a|b|..|z|A|B..|Z
character = letter | digit
firstLine = character;character; ...
secondLine = character
thirdLine = character;character; ...
fourthLine = character;character; ...
rest =  character " " character " " character "\n" ...
